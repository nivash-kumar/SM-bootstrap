# Multi-Agency Mission Tracker

A simple, interactive web application to browse space missions from different agencies like ISRO, NASA, and SpaceX. This project is built with **Bootstrap 5** and **vanilla JavaScript** and uses the **Google Gemini API** to generate fun facts and explanations about the missions.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Agency Selection**: View missions from ISRO, NASA, and SpaceX from a dropdown menu.
* **Dynamic Filtering**: Filter missions by their type (e.g., Lunar, Planetary, Human Spaceflight).
* **Interactive Cards**: Each mission is displayed on a clean, responsive Bootstrap card.
* **AI-Powered Facts**: Click the "Fun Facts" button to open a modal and get interesting, AI-generated trivia about the selected mission.
* **Tech Explanations**: Inside the modal, get simple explanations for the mission's launch vehicle and orbit type.
* **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts smoothly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: HTML5, Bootstrap 5, CSS3
* **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **API**: Google Gemini API

## üöÄ Getting Started

No complex build steps are required to run this project.

### Prerequisites

You will need a modern web browser and a **Google Gemini API Key**.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/mission-tracker.git](https://github.com/your-username/mission-tracker.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd mission-tracker
    ```
3.  **Open in Browser:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to run the application.

## üîß How It Works

The application is contained within a single `index.html` file for simplicity.

* **`missionData` Object**: Mission information (name, type, vehicle, etc.) is stored in a static JavaScript object at the top of the script block. This acts as a local database.
* **`renderMissions()`**: This function dynamically creates Bootstrap cards for each mission based on the currently selected agency and filter.
* **`callGemini()` Function**: When a user clicks "Fun Facts" or "Explain the Tech", a prompt is constructed and sent to the Google Gemini API via this `async` function.
* **Bootstrap Modal**: The response from the API is then displayed in a Bootstrap modal component, which is controlled entirely by Bootstrap's JavaScript API.
